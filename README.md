### Hiii 👋

It's Sansiri 😀 
- I'm from Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭.
- I’m a computer scientist (recently graduated 🎉) with specialization in AI/ML, Deep Learning, NLP, and Data Analytics.
- I code 👩‍💻, read 👩‍🏫, and doodle 👩‍🎨. 
- I also like to explain things – the process of breaking down information into simpler and more understandable concepts is what I find pretty fun and appealing 🌱🌺🌸🌼🌻🌾.
