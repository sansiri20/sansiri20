### Hi there! 👋😀

It's Sansiri  
- I'm from Bangkok, Thailand.
- I'm a computer scientist (recently graduated 🎉) with specialization in AI/ML, Deep Learning, NLP, and Data Analytics.
- I code 👩‍💻, read 👩‍🏫, and doodle 👩‍🎨. 
- I like to explain things – the process of breaking down information into simpler and understandable concepts is what I find pretty appealing 🌱🌾.
